# DL Notebooks 🎓🤖

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find various notebooks demonstrating essential AI and Machine Learning concepts. Each notebook dives into a different model or technique, providing practical insights and hands-on examples. 🚀

## What's Inside? 🔍

1. **Transformers for NLP & More**  
   Explore the powerful **Transformer architecture**! 🧠✨ This model revolutionized the world of Natural Language Processing and more with its self-attention mechanism. Perfect for handling sequential data across many domains.

2. **Classifying Images with Transformers** 🖼️🔎  
   Take a deep dive into **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, where image classification is tackled without convolutional layers. See how Transformers can bring top-tier performance to image-based tasks.

3. **Word Embeddings Explained** ✍️🔡  
   Discover how to represent words as vectors! 🌍 In this notebook, you'll learn about **word embeddings** like Word2Vec, and how they help capture the semantic meaning behind words in Natural Language Processing.

4. **Understanding Spectrograms** 🎶🔊  
   Get a visual look at sound! 🎧 This notebook teaches you how to convert audio signals into spectrograms, an essential technique for speech and audio recognition tasks.

5. **Audio Classification with VGGish** 🎼🗣️  
   Implement the **VGGish model** for audio classification tasks! This notebook walks you through using a pre-trained model for feature extraction and sound event detection using a sample audio.
